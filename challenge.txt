Coding Challenge Part 1: Discount Price
Calculating discounted price of an item.

You are given two values stored in variables called price and discountPercentage.
Let listPrice =100 discountPercentage =25

Task is to calculate the price of the product after applying the said discount and display it in the console.
Given code:
* let listPrice=100
* let discountPercentage=25

Hint:

Formula to calculate discount_price is
* discount price = (list price) - ((list price) * 25/100)

Coding Challenge Part 2: Area Of A Circle
Area of circle
Area of a circle is calculated by a mathematical formula a = pi * radius^2
Given the radius of a circle as 50, calculate the area of the circle and display a message
Area of the circle with radius 50 is 9000 sq meters
If area has any decimal values, make sure to remove them
==========================================================
Coding challenge: if/else

Let's say to apply as a candidate for a local basketball team,you need to be at least 175 cm tall.

write a program to determine if a candidate is qualified to apply for the team depending on his height.

If the height is greater than or equal to 175, display a message

"You qualify to apply"

If height is less than 175, display a message

"You are not qualified to apply."
